# Introduction

In the previous lesson, we introduced the distinction between content (the HTML
document) and presentation ("Cascading Style Sheets" or CSS). Browsers combine
the content and presentation layers to display HTML documents (web pages) to
you. Now it's time to dive a little deeper into the presentation topic by
learning more about CSS, the standard language for styling and laying out HTML
elements.  If you have ever been delighted by how a website appears or have
been amazed how the same content looks great on a browser _and also_ great on a
mobile device, you have CSS to thank for it.

# How Does Writing CSS Differ From Writing HTML?

As we write CSS these are the type of questions we might ask ourselves:

- Should the layout of the text be in a single or double column?
- Should we use a different font color for the header?
- How should the same content appear differently on a desktop vs. a mobile
device?

All of the questions above deal with the *aesthetic* considerations of the page.
These are the concerns of the presentation layer (CSS).

As a contrast, let's consider the type of questions we might ask ourselves as
we write HTML:

- Does the order of items within a list matter? Should it be a numbered list?
- Should we wrap a list of links inside a navigation tag?
- Is this the most important header in the whole HTML document?

The last few questions deal with structure, hierarchy, and meaning. These are
the concerns of the content layer (HTML).

When we write CSS, we focus on aesthetic and display considerations. When we
write HTML, we focus on structure, hierarchy, and meaning.

# The Process of Styling

The process of styling HTML can be described in three steps:

1. Identify the specific HTML element we wish to style.
2. Determine what aesthetic characteristics ("CSS properties") we wish to
   modify. In the case of text, do we wish to change the color of
   the font?
3. Determine the desired state of aesthetic characteristic ("CSS property"). In
   the case of text, do we wish the color to appear red, blue, etc.?

# The Basics of CSS

How can we translate the process of styling into CSS?

1. **CSS selectors** are used to **identify HTML elements**
2. **CSS properties** are used to **express the aesthetic characteristics we wish
   to style**
3. **CSS Property Values** are used to **express the desired states of the
   aesthetic characteristics**

Below we will explore CSS selectors, CSS properties, and CSS property values in
more detail.

## CSS Selectors

CSS Selectors are a way of declaring which HTML element(s) we wish to style.
Selectors can be based on:

- the type of HTML element(`h1`, `p`, `div`, etc.)
- the value of an element's `id` or `class` (`<p id='idvalue'></p>`,
`<p class='classvalue'></p>`)
- the value of an element's attributes (`value="hello"`)
- the element's relationship with surrounding elements (a `p` within an
  `.infobox`)

The element type, `id`, and `class` are the most commonly used selectors. Let's
review a few examples of each selector.

### Type Selectors

Type selectors are used to select elements based on their HTML element type.
The type selector syntax is simply: `htmlelementname`.

```css
/*
selects all headers of type h3 in the document (e.g. <h3>Type selectors</h3>)
*/
h3

/*
selects all paragraph elements in the document (e.g. <p>Type selectors are used
to...</p>)
*/
p

/*
p.s. The CSS comment syntax is text between "slash-star" and "star-slash"
*/

```

You can find more information about type selectors on the Mozilla Developer
Network [type selectors documentation][].

### ID Selectors

Selectors based on the `id` of the element are called "ID Selectors.  **There
should be only one element with a given ID** in an HTML document. The ID
selector syntax is: `#idvalue`. Simply prefix the id attribute of an element
with a '#'.

```css
/*
selects the HTML element with the id 'main-header' (e.g. <h1 id='main-header'>)
*/
#main-header

/*
selects the HTML element with the id 'welcome-message' (e.g. <p id='welcome-message'>)
*/
#welcome-message
```

You can find more information about ID selectors on the Mozilla Developer Network
[id selectors documentation][].

### Class Selectors

Class selectors are used to **select all elements that share a given class
name**. The class selector syntax is: `.classname`. Simply prefix the class
name with a '.'.

```css
/*
select all elements that have the 'important-topic' classname (e.g. <h1 class='important-topic'>
and <h1 class='important-topic'>)
*/
.important-topic

/*
select all elements that have the 'welcome-message' classname (e.g. <p class='helpful-hint'>
and <p class='helpful-hint'>)
*/
.helpful-hint
```

You can find more information about class selectors on the Mozilla Developer
Network [class selectors documentation][].

## CSS Property Names

Each element has a finite list of aesthetic characteristics that can be styled.
CSS property names identify those characteristics. Each element will have a
different set of property names. For text styling, examples of property names
include text `color`, `text-align` and `line-height`.

## CSS Property Values

CSS Property Values are directly related to property names. If we are working
with the `color` property, the value could be a named color such as `red`.

## CSS Declaration

A CSS property name paired with a CSS property value is a **CSS declaration**.

```css
color: blue;
/*
This is a css declaration
'color' is a property name and 'blue' is a css property value
!!!!! CSS declarations must end with a semi-colon (;) !!!!!
*/
```

## CSS Declaration Blocks

How can we apply the CSS declaration `color: blue` to a specific HTML
element(s)?  We need to combine our CSS declaration with a CSS selector. The
association between one or more CSS declarations and a CSS selector is called a
**CSS declaration block**. CSS declarations (one or more) that applied to a
specific selector are wrapped by curly braces (`{ }`). Each declaration inside a
declaration block **must** be separated by a semi-colon (`;`).

Below is a sample CSS declaration block.

```css
selector {
  property-name: value;
  property-name: value;
}
```

Let's write a full example declaration block.

```css
/*
The CSS declaration block below will apply to all `h1` elements and will change the
text color to blue and set the font family to Georgia.
*/
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: Georgia;
}
```

## Applying CSS to an HTML Document

Enough reading about HTML and CSS! Let's move on to the next lesson to edit some
CSS code and see how it changes the way the HTML document is displayed in the
browser.
